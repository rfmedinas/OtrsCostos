# ng-rn
## Rename Angular Components

### One Time Usage
```
  npx ng-rn old-button fancy-button
```


### Install
```
  npm i -g ng-rn
```

### Usage
```
  cd /path/to/angular-project/
  ng-rn old-button fancy-button

The Tool looks for the components in `src/app/`. If your components are located in a more complex path like `src/app/my-vip-components`, just change directory:
```
  cd src/app/my-vip-components
  ng-rn old-button fancy-button
```
